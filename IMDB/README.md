# IMBD_EDA
This is my final project  when  I taking an external course in computer science. Four-person that conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IMDB dataset, enabling us to develop models for movie rating prediction and implement clustering techniques. I was responsible for both pre-processing the dataset and developing models using the random forest and neural networks libraries from scikit-learn in Python for movie rating prediction. I also contributed to the EDA by visualizing the dataset.
